<p>This chapter is written to help undergraduate students better understand the role of replication in psychology and how it applies to the study of social behavior. We briefly review various replication initiatives in psychology and the events that preceded our renewed focus on replication. We then discuss challenges in interpreting the low rate of replication in psychology, especially social psychology. Finally, we stress the need for better methods and theories to learn the right lessons when replications fail.</p>
