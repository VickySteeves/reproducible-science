<p>Cell culture is a vital component of laboratories throughout the scientifi c community, yet the absence of standardized protocols and documentation practice challenges laboratory effi ciency and scientific reproducibility. We examined the effectiveness of a cloud-based software application, CultureTrax Â®  as a tool for standardizing and transferring a complex cell culture protocol. The software workfl ow and template were used to electronically format a cardiomyocyte differentiation protocol and share a digitally executable copy with a different lab user. While the protocol was unfamiliar to the recipient, they executed the experiment by solely using CultureTrax and successfully derived cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells. This software tool significantly reduced the time and resources required to effectively transfer and implement a  novel protocol.</p>
