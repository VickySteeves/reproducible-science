<p>This year, also SMI will introduce an Award for Reproducibility to be granted to authors of accepted papers who are willing to provide a complete open-source implementation of their algorithm. The reproducibility stamp does not affect the reviewing process or the requirements for your submission to be accepted. The awarded papers will receive an additional 5 to 10 minutes in their presentation to give a live demo and will be recognized during the SMI closing ceremony. More information on the web site soon.</p>
