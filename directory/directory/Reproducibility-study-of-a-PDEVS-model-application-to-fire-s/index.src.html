<p>The results of a scientific experiment have to be reproduced to be valid. The scientific method is well known in experimental sciences but it is not always the case for computer scientists. Recent publications and studies has shown that there is a significant reproducibility crisis in Biology and Medicine. This problem has also been demonstrated for hundreds of publications in computer science where only a limited set of publication results could be reproduced. In this paper we present the reproducibility challenge and we examine the reproducibility of a Parallel Discrete Event System Specification (PDEVS) model with two different execution frameworks.</p>
