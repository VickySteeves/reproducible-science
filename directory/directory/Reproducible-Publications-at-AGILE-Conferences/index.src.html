<p>The council of the Association of Geographic Information Laboratories in Europe (AGILE) provides funding to support a new AGILE initiative. Reproducible Publications at AGILE Conferences" will develop protocols for publishing reproducible research in AGILE conference publications. The aim is to support and improve the way we describe our science and to enhance the usefulness of AGILE conference publications to the wider community. The potential benefits of this include greater research transparency, enhanced citations of published articles and increased relevance of the conference in the field. The funding will support a workshop attended by domain experts to develop author and reviewer guidelines that will be presented at the AGILE 2019 conference. The initiative members are Daniel Nüst (Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Münster, Münster, Germany), Frank Ostermann (Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands), Rusne Sileryte (Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands), Carlos Granell (Institute of New Imaging Technologies, Universitat Jaume I de Castellón, Castellón, Spain), and Barbara Hofer (Interfaculty Department of Geoinformatics - Z_GIS, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria)."</p>
