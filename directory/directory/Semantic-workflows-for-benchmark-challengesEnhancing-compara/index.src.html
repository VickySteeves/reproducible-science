<p>WINGS enables researchers to submit complete semantic  workflows  as  challenge  submissions.    By  submitting  entries  as  workflows,  it  then becomes possible to compare not just the results and performance of a challenger, but also the methodology employed.  This is particularly important when dozens of challenge entries may use nearly  identical  tools,  but  with  only  subtle  changes  in  parameters  (and  radical  differences  in results). WINGS uses a component driven workflow design and offers intelligent parameter and data selectionby reasoning  aboutdata  characteristics.</p>
