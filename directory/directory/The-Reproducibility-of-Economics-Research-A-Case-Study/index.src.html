<p>Published reproductions or replications of economics research are rare.  However, recent years have seen increased  recognition  of  the  important  role  of  replication  in  the  scientific  endeavor.   We  describe  and present  the  results  of  a  large  reproduction  exercise  in  which  we  assess  the  reproducibility  of  research articles published in the American Economic Journal:  Applied Economics over the last decade.  69 of 162 eligible replication attempts successfuly replicated the articleâ€™s analysis 42.6%.  A further 68 (42%) were at least partially successful.  A total of 98 out of 303 (32.3%) relied on confidential or proprietary data, and were thus not reproducible by this project.  We also conduct several bibliometric analyses of reproducible vs. non-reproducible articles.</p>
