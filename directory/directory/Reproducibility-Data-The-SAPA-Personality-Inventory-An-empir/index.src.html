<p>Unlike most other SAPA datasets available on Dataverse, these data are specifically tied to the reproducible manuscript entitled "The SAPA Personality Inventory: An empirically-derived, hierarchically-organized self-report personality assessment model." Most of these files are images that should be downloaded and organized in the same location as the source .Rnw file. A few files contain data that have already been processed (and could be independently re-created using code in the .Rnw file) - these are included to shorten the processing time needed to reproduce the original document. The raw data files for most of the analyses are stored in 3 separate locations, 1 for each of the 3 samples. These are: Exploratory sample - doi:10.7910/DVN/SD7SVE Replication sample - doi:10.7910/DVN/3LFNJZ Confirmatory sample - doi:10.7910/DVN/I8I3D3 . If you have any questions about reproducing the file, please first consult the instructions in the Preface of the PDF version. Note that the .Rnw version of the file includes many annotations that are not visible in the PDF version (https://sapa-project.org/research/SPI/SPIdevelopment.pdf) and which may also be useful. If you still have questions, feel free to email me directly. Note that it is unlikely that I will be able to help with technical issues that do not relate of R, Knitr, Sweave, and LaTeX.</p>
