<p>The safest solution would be to store copies of every object, ever created during the data analysis. All forks, wrong paths, everything. Along with detailed information which functions with what parameters were used to generate each result. Something like the ultimate TimeMachine or GitHub for R objects. With such detailed information, every analysis would be auditable and replicable. Right now the full tracking of all created objects is not possible without deep changes in the R interpreter. The archivist is the light-weight version of such solution.</p>
