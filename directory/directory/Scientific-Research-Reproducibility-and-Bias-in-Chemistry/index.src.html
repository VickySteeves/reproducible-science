<p>When scientists are able to recreate earlier research results, published by other scientists, the research is considered reproducible. But what happens when the results donâ€™t match? It means that the initial research is non-reproducible. Reproducibility, or non-reproducibility, of scientific experiments seems straightforward; it implies that an experimental result is either valid or invalid. In fact, researchers affiliated with Stanford University, Tufts University, and University of Ioannina in Greece concluded in 2005 that a majority of all research findings are false. How do those invalid results end up in scientific papers? A group of Stanford researchers concluded that, in many cases, bias is to blame.</p>
