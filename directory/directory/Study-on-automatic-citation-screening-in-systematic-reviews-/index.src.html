<p>Research into text mining based tool support for citation screening in systematic reviews is growing. The field has not experienced much independent validation. It is anticipated that more transparency in studies will increase reproducibility and in-depth understanding leading to the maturation of the field. The citation screen tool presented aims to support research transparency, reproducibility and timely evolution of sustainable tools.</p>
