<p>Standardized, reproducible, and feasible quantification ofb-cell function (BCF) is necessary for the evaluation of interventions to improve insulin secretion and important for comparison across studies. We therefore characterized the re-sponses to, and reproducibility of, standardized methods of in vivo BCF across different glucose tolerance states.  Reproducibility for the AST was very good, with ICC values >0.8 across all variables and populations.</p>
