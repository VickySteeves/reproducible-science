<p>We want to enable our authors to publish the best research and maximize the benefit of research funding, which includes achieving good practice in the sharing and archiving of research data. We also aim to facilitate authorsâ€™ compliance with institution and research funder requirements to share data. Encourage publication of more open and reproducible research.</p>
