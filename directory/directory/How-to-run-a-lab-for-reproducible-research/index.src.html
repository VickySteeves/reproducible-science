<p>As a principal investigator, how do you run your lab for reproducibility? I submit the following action areas: commitment, transparency and open science, onboarding, collaboration, community and leadership. Make a public commitment to reproducible research—what this means for you could differ from others, but an essential core is common to all. Transparency is an essential value, and embracing open science is the best route to realize it. Onboarding every lab member with a deliberate group “syllabus” for reproducibility sets the expectations high. What is your list of must-read literature on reproducible research? I can share mine with you: my lab members helped to make it. For collaborating efficiently and building community, we take inspiration from the open-source world. We adopt its technology platforms to work on software and to communicate, openly and collaboratively. Key to the open-source culture is to give credit—give lots of credit for every contribution: code, documentation, tests, issue reports! The tools and methods require training, but running a lab for reproducibility is your decision. Start here–>commitment.</p>
