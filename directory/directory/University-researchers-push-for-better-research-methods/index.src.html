<p>Faculty members and graduate students at the University of Minnesota have formed a workshop to hold discussions about reproducibility in research studies. The discussions come during a national movement to replicate research in social science fields, such as psychology. The movement has shown many previous studies are not reliable.  After discussions last spring regarding ways the University can address these research practices, the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science designed workshops for faculty and students to discuss ways to develop replicable research methods.</p>
