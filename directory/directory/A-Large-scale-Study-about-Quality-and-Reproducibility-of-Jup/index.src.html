<p>Jupyter  Notebooks  have  been  widely  adopted  by many different communities, both in science and industry. They support  the  creation  of  literate  programming  documents  that combine  code,  text,  and  execution  results  with  visualizations and  all  sorts  of  rich  media.  The  self-documenting  aspects  andthe  ability  to  reproduce  results  have  been  touted  as  significant benefits  of  notebooks.  At  the  same  time,  there  has  been  growing  criticism  that  the  way  notebooks  are  being  used  leads  to unexpected behavior, encourage poor coding practices, and that their results can be hard to reproduce. To understand good and bad  practices  used  in  the  development  of  real  notebooks,  we studied 1.4 million notebooks from GitHub. We present a detailed analysis  of  their  characteristics  that  impact  reproducibility.  We also propose a set of best practices that can improve the rate of reproducibility and discuss open challenges that require further research  and  development.</p>
