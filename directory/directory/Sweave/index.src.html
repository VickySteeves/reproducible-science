<p>Sweave is a tool that allows to embed the R code for complete data analyses in latex documents, and is automatically packaged in R installations. The purpose is to create dynamic reports, which can be updated automatically if data or analysis change. Instead of inserting a prefabricated graph or table into the report, the master document contains the R code necessary to obtain it. When run through R, all data analysis output (tables, graphs, etc.) is created on the fly and inserted into a final latex document. The report can be automatically updated if data or analysis change, which allows for truly reproducible research. It does not, however, track provenance.</p>
