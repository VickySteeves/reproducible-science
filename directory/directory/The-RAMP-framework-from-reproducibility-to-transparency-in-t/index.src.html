<p>The RAMP (Rapid Analytics and Model Prototyping) is a software and project management tool developed by the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science. The original goal was to accelerate the adoption of high-quality data science solutions for domain science problems by running rapid collaborative prototyping sessions. Today it is a full-blown data science project management tool promoting reproducibility, fair and transparent model evaluation, and democratization of data science.  We have used the framework for setting up and solving about twenty scientific problems, for organizing scientific sub-communities around these events, and for training novice data scientists.</p>
