<p>We propose an approach for improved reproducibility that includes capturing and relating provenance characteristics and performance metrics, in a hybrid queriable system, the ProvEn server. The system capabilities are illustrated on two use cases: scientific reproducibility of results in the ACME climate simulations and performance reproducibility in molecular dynamics workflows on HPC computing platforms.</p>
