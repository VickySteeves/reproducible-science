<p>While reproducibility has been a requirement in natural sciences for centuries, computational experiments have not followed the same standard. Often, there is insufficient information to reproduce computational results described in publications, and in the recent past, this has led to many retractions. Although scientists are aware of the numerous benefits of reproducibility, the perceived amount of work to make results reproducible is a significant disincentive. Fortunately, much of the information needed to reproduce an experiment can be obtained by systematically capturing its provenance. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of provenance and how they can be used to support reproducibility. We also describe a representative set of provenance tools and approaches that make it easy to create reproducible experiments.</p>
