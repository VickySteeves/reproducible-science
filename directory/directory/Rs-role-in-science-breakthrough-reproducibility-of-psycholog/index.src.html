<p>R is a natural fit for a reproducibility project like this: as a scripting language, the R script itself provides a reproducible documentation of every step of the process. (Revolution R Open, Microsoft's enhanced R distribution, additionally includes features to facilitate reproducibility when using R packages.) The R script used for the psychology replication project describes and executes the process for checking the results of the papers.</p>
