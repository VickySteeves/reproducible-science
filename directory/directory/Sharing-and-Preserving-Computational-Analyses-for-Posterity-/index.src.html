<p>Open  data  and  open-source  software  may be  part  of  the  solution  to  sciences  reproducibility crisis,   but   they   are   insufficient   to   guarantee   reproducibility. Requiring minimal end-user expertise, encapsulator creates a "time capsule" with reproducible code (right now, only supporting R code) in a self-contained computational environment. encapsulator provides end-users with a fully-featured desktop environment for reproducible research.</p>
