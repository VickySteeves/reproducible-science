<p>In scientometrics, we have not yet had an intensive debate about the reproducibility of research published in our field, although concerns about  a  lack  of  reproducibility  have occasionally surfaced (see e.g. Glänzel & Schöpflin 1994 and Van den Besselaar et al. 2017), and the need to improve the reproducibility is used as an important argument for open citation data  (see www.issi-society.org/open-citations-letter/).  We  initiated  a  first  discussion  about reproducibility  in  scientometrics  with  a  workshop  at  ISSI  2017  in  Wuhan. One of the outcomes was the sense that scientific fields differ with regard to the type and pervasiveness of  threats to the reproducibility  of  their  published  research,  last  but  not  least  due  to  their differences in modes of knowledge production, such as confirmatory versus exploratory study designs, and differences in methods and empirical objects.</p>
