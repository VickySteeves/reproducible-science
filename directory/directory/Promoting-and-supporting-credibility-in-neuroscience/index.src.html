<p>Over the coming years, a core objective of the BNA is to promote and support credibility in neuroscience, facilitating a cultural shift away from ‘publish or perish’ towards one which is best for neuroscience, neuroscientists, policymakers and the public. Among many of our credibility activities, we will lead by example by ensuring that our journal, Brain and Neuroscience Advances, exemplifies scientific practices that aim to improve the reproducibility, replicability and reliability of neuroscience research. To support these practices, we are implementing some of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines, including badges for open data, open materials and preregistered studies. The journal also offers the Registered Report (RR) article format. In this editorial, we describe our expectations for articles submitted to Brain and Neuroscience Advances.</p>
