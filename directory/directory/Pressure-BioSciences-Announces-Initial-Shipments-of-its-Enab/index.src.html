<p>Pressure BioSciences, Inc. (PBIO) ("PBI" or the "Company") today announced the initial shipments of its recently released, next-generation pressure cycling technology ("PCT")-based instrument, the Barocycler 2320EXTREME (the "2320EXT"). A key component to the study's success will be the maximization of the breadth of biomolecular analytes revealed and measured, and the quality and reproducibility of the results generated using the tools chosen by ProCan for both the sample preparation and analytical portions of the study.</p>
