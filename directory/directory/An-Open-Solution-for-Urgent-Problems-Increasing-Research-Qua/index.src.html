<p>Jeffrey Spies, Ph.D., is the Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of the non-profit Center for Open Science. In this presentation, Dr. Spies discusses motivations, values, and common experiences of researchers and scholars in research and publication processes. Spies explores biases toward confirmatory research to the exclusion of exploratory research, funding and reward incentives that conflict with scholarly values, and, costs of delayed research publication -- as measured in human lives. This critical approach to ethics and values in research and publication begs the questions “Where would we be if this [publishing] system were a little more reproducible, a little more efficient?” and asks for an examination of values as revealed by our practice; are we implying that some lives matter more than others? Spies discusses how open output [open access] and open workflow policies and practices assist scholars in aligning their scholarly practices more closely to their scholarly values.
