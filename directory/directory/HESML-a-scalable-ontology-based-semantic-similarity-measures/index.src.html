<p>This work is a detailed companion reproducibility paper of the methods and experiments proposed in three previous works by Lastra-Díaz and García-Serrano, which introduce a set of reproducible experiments on word similarity based on HESML and ReproZip with the aim of exactly reproducing the experimental surveys in the aforementioned works. This work introduces a new representation model for taxonomies called PosetHERep, and a Java software library called Half-Edge Semantic Measures Library (HESML) based on it, which implements most ontology-based semantic similarity measures and Information Content (IC) models based on WordNet reported in the literature.</p>
