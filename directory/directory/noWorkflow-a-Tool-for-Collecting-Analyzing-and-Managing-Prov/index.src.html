<p>We present noWorkflow, an open-source tool that systematically and transparently collects provenance from Python scripts, including data about the script execution and how the script evolves over time. During the demo, we will show how noWorkflow collects and manages provenance, as well as how it supports the analysis of computational experiments.We will also encourage attendees to use noWorkflow for their own scripts.</p>
