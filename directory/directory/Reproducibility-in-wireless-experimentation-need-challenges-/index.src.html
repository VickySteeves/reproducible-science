<p>Wireless networks are the key enabling technology of the mobile revolution. However, experimental mobile and wireless research is still hindered by the lack of a solid framework to adequately evaluate the performance of a wide variety of techniques and protocols proposed by the community. In this talk, I will motivate the need for experimental reproducibility as a necessary aspect for healthy progress as accepted by other communities. I will illustrate how other research communities went through similar processes. I will then present the unique challenges of mobile and wireless experimentation, and discuss approaches, past, current, and future to address these challenges. Finally, I will discuss how reproducibility extends to mobile and wireless security research.</p>
