<p>Most efforts to estimate the reproducibility of published findings have focused on specific areas of research, even though science is usually assessed and funded on a regional or national basis. Here we describe a project to assess the reproducibility of findings in biomedical science published by researchers based in Brazil. The Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative is a systematic, multi-center effort to repeatbetween 60 and 100 experiments: theproject will focus on a set of common laboratory methods, repeating each experiment in three different laboratories. The results, due in 2021, will allow us to estimate the level of reproducibility of biomedical sciencein Brazil, and to investigate what the published literature can tell us about the reproducibility ofresearch in a given area.</p>
