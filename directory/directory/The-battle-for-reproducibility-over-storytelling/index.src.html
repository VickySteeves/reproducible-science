<p>This issue of Cortex plays host to a lively debate about the reliability of cognitive neuroscience research. Across seven Discussion Forum pieces, scientists representing a range of backgrounds and career levels reflect on whether the "reproducibility crisis" – or "credibility revolution" (Vazire, 2018; Munafò et al., 2017) – that has achieved such prominence in psychology has extended into cognitive neuroscience. If so, they ask, what is the underlying cause and how can we solve it?</p>
