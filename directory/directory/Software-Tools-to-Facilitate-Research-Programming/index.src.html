<p>Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, 2012: "By understanding the unique challenges faced during research programming, it becomes possible to apply techniques from dynamic program analysis, mixed-initiative recommendation systems, and OS-level tracing to make research programmers more productive. This dissertation characterizes the research programming process, describes typical challenges faced by research programmers, and presents five software tools that I have developed to address some key challenges."</p>
