<p>In this  paper  we  present  a  software  tool  for  elicitation  and  management  of  process  metadata.   It  follows  our  previously  published design idea of an assistant for researchers that aims at minimizing the additional effort required for producing a sustainable workflow documentation.   With  the  ever-growing  number  of  linguistic  resources  available,  it  also  becomes  increasingly  important  to  provide proper  documentation  to  make  them  comparable  and  to  allow  meaningful  evaluations  for  specific  use  cases.   The  often  prevailing practice  of  post  hoc  documentation  of  resource  generation  or  research  processes  bears  the  risk  of  information  loss.   Not  only  does detailed documentation of a process aid in achieving reproducibility, it also increases usefulness of the documented work for others as a cornerstone of good scientific practice.  Time pressure together with the lack of simple documentation methods leads to workflow documentation in practice being an arduous and often neglected task. Our tool ensures a clean documentation for common workflows in natural language processing and digital humanities. Additionally, it can easily be integrated into existing institutional infrastructures.</p>
