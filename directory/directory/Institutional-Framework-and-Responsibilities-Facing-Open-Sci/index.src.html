<p>This presentation to LERU workshop: Nurturing a Culture of Responsible Research in the Era of Open Science considered the issue of the credibility of science being in question in a 'post-truth' world and how reproducibility is adding to the problem. Open Science offers a solution, but it is not easy to implement, particularly by research institutions. The main issues relate to language used in the open space, that solutions look different to different disciplines, that researchers are often feeling "under siege" and that we need to reward good open practice.</p>
