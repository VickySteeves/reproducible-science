<p>This document reviews the stability of the main LHC operational parameters, namely orbit, tune, coupling and chromaticity. The analysis will be based on the LSA settings, measured parameters and real-time trims. The focus will be set on ramp and high energy reproducibility as they are more diflicult to assess and correct on a daily basis for certain parameters like chromaticity and coupling. The reproducibility of the machine in collision will be analysed in detail, in particular the beam offsets at the IPS since the ever decreasing beam sizes at the IPs make beam steering at the IP more and mode delicate.</p>
