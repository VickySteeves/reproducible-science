    <p>Mechanobiology, the study of how mechanical forces affect cellular behavior, is an emerging field of study that has garnered broad and significant interest. Researchers are currently seeking to better understand how mechanical signals are transmitted, detected, and integrated at a subcellular level. One tool for addressing these questions is a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)‐based tension sensor, which enables the measurement of molecular‐scale forces across proteins based on changes in emitted light. However, the reliability and reproducibility of measurements made with these sensors has not been thoroughly examined. To address these concerns, we developed numerical methods that improve the accuracy of measurements made using sensitized emission‐based imaging. To establish that FRET‐based tension sensors are versatile tools that provide consistent measurements, we used these methods, and demonstrated that a vinculin tension sensor is unperturbed by cell fixation, permeabilization, and immunolabeling. This suggests FRET‐based tension sensors could be coupled with a variety of immuno‐fluorescent labeling techniques. Additionally, as tension sensors are frequently employed in complex biological samples where large experimental repeats may be challenging, we examined how sample size affects the uncertainty of FRET measurements. In total, this work establishes guidelines to improve FRET‐based tension sensor measurements, validate novel implementations of these sensors, and ensure that results are precise and reproducible.</p>

    <p>Trusting simulation output is crucial for Sandia's mission objectives. We rely on these simulations to perform our high-consequence mission tasks given national treaty obligations. Other science and modeling applications, while they may have high-consequence results, still require the strongest levels of trust to enable using the result as the foundation for both practical applications and future research. To this end, the computing community has developed workflow and provenance systems to aid in both automating simulation and modeling execution as well as determining exactly how was some output was created so that conclusions can be drawn from the data. Current approaches for workflows and provenance systems are all at the user level and have little to no system level support making them fragile, difficult to use, and incomplete solutions. The introduction of container technology is a first step towards encapsulating and tracking artifacts used in creating data and resulting insights, but their current implementation is focused solely on making it easy to deploy an application in an isolated "sandbox" and maintaining a strictly read-only mode to avoid any potential changes to the application. All storage activities are still using the system-level shared storage. This project explores extending the container concept to include storage as a new container type we call \emph{data pallets}. Data Pallets are potentially writeable, auto generated by the system based on IO activities, and usable as a way to link the contained data back to the application and input deck used to create it.</p>

    <p>The literature on the reproducibility crisis presents several putative causes for the proliferation of irreproducible results, including HARKing, p-hacking and publication bias. Without a theory of reproducibility, however, it is difficult to determine whether these putative causes can explain most irreproducible results. Drawing from an historically informed conception of science that is open and collaborative, we identify the components of an idealized experiment and analyze these components as a precursor to develop such a theory. Openness, we suggest, has long been intuitively proposed as a solution to irreproducibility. However, this intuition has not been validated in a theoretical framework. Our concern is that the under-theorizing of these concepts can lead to flawed inferences about the (in)validity of experimental results or integrity of individual scientists. We use probabilistic arguments and examine how openness of experimental components relates to reproducibility of results. We show that there are some impediments to obtaining reproducible results that precede many of the causes often cited in literature on the reproducibility crisis. For example, even if erroneous practices such as HARKing, p-hacking, and publication bias were absent at the individual and system level, reproducibility may still not be guaranteed.</p>

    <p>Although essential to the development of a robust evidence base for nurse educators, the concepts of replication and reproducibility have received little attention in the nursing education literature. In this Methodology Corner installment, the concepts of study replication and reproducibility are explored in depth. In designing, conducting, and documenting the findings of studies in nursing education, researchers are encouraged to make design choices that improve study replicability and reproducibility of study findings. [J Nurs Educ. 2018;57(11):638–640.] There has been considerable discussion in the professional literature about questionable research practices that raise doubt about the credibility of research findings (Shrout &amp; Rodgers, 2018) and that limit reproducibility of research findings (Shepherd, Peratikos, Rebeiro, Duda, &amp; McCowan, 2017). This discussion has led to what scientists term as a replication crisis (Goodman, Fanelli, &amp; Ioannidis, 2016). Although investigators in various disciplines have provided suggestions to address this crisis (Alvarez, Key, &amp; Núñez, 2018; Goodman et al., 2016; Shrout &amp; Rodgers, 2018), similar discussions or reports of replication within nursing education literature are limited, despite a call for replication studies (Morin, 2016). Consequently, the focus of this article is on replication and reproducibility. The topic is important, given that the hallmark of good science is being able to replicate or reproduce findings (Morin, 2016). Replication serves to provide “stability in our knowledge of nature” (Schmidt, 2009, p. 92).</p>

    <p>Cell culture is a vital component of laboratories throughout the scientifi c community, yet the absence of standardized protocols and documentation practice challenges laboratory effi ciency and scientific reproducibility. We examined the effectiveness of a cloud-based software application, CultureTrax ®  as a tool for standardizing and transferring a complex cell culture protocol. The software workfl ow and template were used to electronically format a cardiomyocyte differentiation protocol and share a digitally executable copy with a different lab user. While the protocol was unfamiliar to the recipient, they executed the experiment by solely using CultureTrax and successfully derived cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells. This software tool significantly reduced the time and resources required to effectively transfer and implement a  novel protocol.</p>

    <p>Replicability and reproducibility of computational models has been somewhat understudied by “the replication movement.” In this paper, we draw on methodological studies into the replicability of psychological experiments and on the mechanistic account of explanation to analyze the functions of model replications and model reproductions in computational neuroscience. We contend that model replicability, or independent researchers' ability to obtain the same output using original code and data, and model reproducibility, or independent researchers' ability to recreate a model without original code, serve different functions and fail for different reasons. This means that measures designed to improve model replicability may not enhance (and, in some cases, may actually damage) model reproducibility. We claim that although both are undesirable, low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability. In our opinion, low model reproducibility stems mostly from authors' omitting to provide crucial information in scientific papers and we stress that sharing all computer code and data is not a solution. Reports of computational studies should remain selective and include all and only relevant bits of code.</p>
